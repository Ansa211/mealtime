CfM fetches daily menus of places around MalÃ¡ strana we usually frequent. This page saves me about 15s every day.

## Requirements
`php, php-cli, php-common, php-fpm, php-json, php-xml` version `>=7.3.0` should be enough.

## FAQ
#### I want to add a new place.
Either open a pull request or email me.

#### The code is absolute garbage!
Yes.

#### It looks weird on my phone.
It's 2019. I'd be surprised if something actually rendered correctly.
